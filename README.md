| Git is a software.  | GitHub is a service.  |
| Git is a command-line tool  | GitHub is a graphical user interface  |
| Git is installed locally on the system  | GitHub is hosted on the web |
| Git is focused on version control and code sharing.| GitHub is focused on centralized source code hosting.  |
| Git has no user management feature.  | GitHub has built-in user management feature  |

DAY 2
```
- What is a "Repository" or "Repo"?       
>It is a workspace and one thing we have to remember that every project should have different repositories.

| Git Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `git init` | Creates an empty git repository.                |



- Steps to Use "git init" using terminal:
1. We open "Terminal".
2. Go to a desired position.
3. Make a Directory/Folder by "mkdir".
4. Then use "git init".

:warning: Do Not 'git init' a repository inside a repository.:warning:

If you did make a repository inside a repository itself, then you have to delete the **folder** consisting the second repository.


- COMMITTING
>In Git, commit is the term used for saving changes. Git does not add changes to a commit automatically. You need to indicate which file and changes need to be saved before running the Git commit command. The commit command does not save changes in remote servers, only in the local repository of Git.


```
DAY 3
```

The **"COMMITTING WORKFLOW"** goes like this:
<!-- - First we Make A Folder/File and write some stuff inside it.
- Then we will use `git status` command to see if the folder is alreaady in a repo or not. If not then,
- Then we use the `git init` command to make a `.git` hidden file. (Don't Make a .git file inside a repository).
- Then we will use command  -->
